# Pong

I'm following a [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/) to make a game and learn some cool stuff!

I believe I'll be making that cool vintage game, pong.

## You may notice quite a few differences between my code and the instructor's. ![This is fine.](https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png)

##### Thank you for taking an interest in my code.

### Best,

## Alexander.
